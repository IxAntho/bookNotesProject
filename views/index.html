        ReadRecall is a personal book tracking and note-taking platform inspired
        by Derek Sivers' website. It's designed for avid readers who want to
        retain and revisit key insights from the books they've read. Users can
        log non-fiction books, add detailed notes, rate their reads, and record
        completion dates. The platform allows for easy sorting by rating,
        recency, and title, making it simple to revisit and reflect on your
        literary journey. ReadRecall turns your reading habit into a valuable,
        accessible knowledge base, ensuring that the most impactful ideas from
        each book stay with you long after you've turned the last page.

        <p class="book__overview">
          Everything is negotiable. Challenge authority. You have the power in
          any situation. This is how to realize it and use it. A must-read
          classic from 1980 from a master negotiator. My notes here aren't
          enough because the little book is filled with so many memorable
          stories â€” examples of great day-to-day moments of negotiation that
          will stick in your head for when you need them. (I especially loved
          the one about the power of the prisoner in solitary confinement.) So
          go buy and read the book. I'm giving it a 10/10 rating even though the
          second half of the book loses steam, because the first half is so
          crucial.
